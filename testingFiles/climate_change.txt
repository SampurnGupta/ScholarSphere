Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. It includes shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions. The primary driver of current climate change is human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. Consequences include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and threats to food and water security. Addressing climate change requires coordinated efforts in reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable practices.
