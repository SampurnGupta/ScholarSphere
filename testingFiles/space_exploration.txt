Space exploration involves the discovery and study of celestial bodies beyond Earth. Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the Apollo Moon missions, humanity has continued to reach deeper into space. Agencies like NASA, ESA, and private companies like SpaceX have made significant advancements in rocket technology, satellite deployment, and planetary missions. Mars exploration, lunar bases, and asteroid mining are among the future goals. Space research not only expands our understanding of the universe but also contributes to innovations in technology and materials science on Earth. However, funding, space debris, and international cooperation pose ongoing challenges.
